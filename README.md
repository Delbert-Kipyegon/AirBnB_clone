# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an AirBnB clone, starting with the development of a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects. This initial step is crucial as it sets the foundation for the subsequent stages of the project, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

## Project Structure

### 1. Command Interpreter

The first task involves creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This interpreter will serve as the backbone for interacting with the application and manipulating different entities.

### 2. BaseModel

Implement a parent class called `BaseModel` responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances. This class will play a central role in maintaining consistency across all objects within the AirBnB clone.

### 3. Serialization/Deserialization Flow

Establish a simple flow of serialization/deserialization, allowing seamless conversion between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and files. This standardized process ensures efficient data handling throughout the application.

### 4. Class Hierarchy

Create all classes necessary for AirBnB, such as `User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`, etc. These classes should inherit from the `BaseModel` class, providing a uniform structure for all objects in the system.

### 5. File Storage

Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project, focusing on file storage. This engine will handle the persistent storage of AirBnB objects, enabling data retrieval and modification between different sessions.

### 6. Unit Testing

Create comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine. These tests ensure that each component of the application operates as intended and maintains the expected behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Delbert-Kipyegon/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB-Clone
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the command interpreter.

```bash
python console.py
```

## AirBnB Concept

Before diving into the implementation details, familiarize yourself with the [AirBnB concept page](#airbnb-concept) for a deeper understanding of the project's goals and objectives.

## Next Steps

Once you successfully complete this initial phase, you'll be well-prepared for subsequent tasks involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.
