### What is HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It forms the structure of a webpage.

### How to Create an HTML Page
Creating an HTML page involves writing HTML code in a text editor and saving it with a `.html` extension. This section will guide you through the basic structure of an HTML document.

### What is a Markup Language
A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. It instructs the software how to display the text.

### What is the DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

### Elements and Tags
Elements and tags are the building blocks of HTML. An element is a part of the webpage, while a tag is the code that defines where an element starts and ends.

### Attributes in HTML
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

### How Browsers Load Webpages
This section explains the process a browser undergoes to load a webpage, from parsing HTML to rendering it on the screen.

### What is CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It defines how elements should be displayed.

### Styling Elements with CSS
Learn how to add style to an HTML element using CSS. This involves writing CSS rules and linking them to HTML elements.

### Classes in CSS
Classes are selectors in CSS that allow you to style a specific group of elements. This section explains how to create and use classes.

### Selectors in CSS
Selectors are the part of a CSS rule set that determines which elements the rules apply to. This section covers different types of selectors.

### CSS Specificity Value
Understanding CSS specificity is crucial for writing effective CSS. Learn how to compute the specificity value of different selectors.

### Box Properties in CSS
This section delves into the box model in CSS, which describes how elements are formatted on the screen, including properties like margin, border, padding, and content area.
